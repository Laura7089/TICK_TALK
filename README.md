# TICK_TALK
An experimental 8-bit, bit serial computer.

TICK is an experimental 8-bit, serial arithmetic CPU designed around the commonly available 74HCxx logic series.

TICK uses 26 74HXxx ICs, plust a 32K byte RAM and a 64K x 16-bit ROM - or a ROM emulator.

TICK fits into a 4-layer PCB, sized 100mm x 110mm. It has 5 principal connectors that allow you to access all of the main signals and buses.

PCB Headers are included that will allow a very low-cost Raspberry Pi Pico (clone) to be plugged in, providing emulation of the ROM and also implementing a simple serial interface to a laptop or PC.

TICK has evolved slowly over several months, and this repo reflects the most recent design files, manufacturing data and BOM. The earlier repo "TICK" is purely reserved for earlier work. All current and future developments will be documented here.
